# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a minimal Node.js project in early initialization phase. The repository currently contains:
- `package-lock.json` - Empty package lock file indicating Node.js project setup
- No source code, build configuration, or dependencies yet

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project without a package.json, you'll need to initialize it first:

```bash
npm init -y                    # Initialize package.json
npm install <dependencies>     # Install any required packages
```

## Architecture

This appears to be the "sensemaker" project in early development. The project structure and architecture will need to be established as development progresses.

## Next Steps for Development

- Create package.json with project configuration
- Establish project structure and initial dependencies
- Set up build tooling, testing framework, and development scripts
- Define the project's core functionality and architecture
